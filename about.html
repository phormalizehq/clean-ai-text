    <h1>About AI Text Purifier</h1>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>AI Text Purifier</strong>, your go-to utility for cleaning and formatting AI-generated content.</p>
    
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>As AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude become part of our daily lives, we noticed a recurring problem: copying text often results in messy Markdown formatting, strange symbols, and inconsistent spacing. We built this one-page tool to help professionals, students, and writers instantly "purify" their text for emails, reports, and messages.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Our tool runs entirely in your web browser. When you paste text, our custom scripts strip away the markdown clutter while preserving the readability of your content. We also provide real-time word and character counts to help you stay within your limits.</p>

    <h2>Privacy First</h2>
    <p>We do not store your text. Everything you paste into our editor stays on your computer and is never sent to our servers. Your data is your own.</p>
