        <!-- Article 1 -->
        <article>
            <h2>1. The 'AI-Talk' Detox: Humanizing Your Content</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence models like ChatGPT and Claude have a distinct "fingerprint." They often rely on a repetitive vocabulary including words like "delve," "leverage," "tapestry," and "meticulous." While these words aren't incorrect, their over-usage screams "AI-generated" to savvy readers and search engines.</p>
            <p>To humanize your text, use the <strong>Find & Replace</strong> tool in CleanTextApp. Start by scanning your text for these common AI crutch words. Replace "delve into" with "examine" or "look at." Change "testament to" to "proof of." By swapping just 3–5 of these words, you instantly shift the tone from robotic to authentic.</p>
            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use the "lowercase" button after replacing titles to ensure they don't look like they were generated by a headline bot, then manually capitalize only the words you want.

        <!-- Article 2 -->
        <article>
            <h2>2. Prep AI Interviews for Social Media & Video</h2>
            <p>Social media scripts and video teleprompters require clean, distraction-free text. When you ask an AI to "Write a script for a TikTok," it often includes stage directions in brackets like [Upbeat Music Plays] or **Bold Speaker Names**.</p>
            <p>Pasting this directly into a teleprompter app can cause the speaker to stumble. Use the <strong>Purify Text</strong> button to instantly strip away the markdown bolding and italics. For stage directions, use Find & Replace to delete them entirely by leaving the "Replace with" field empty. This creates a smooth "scroll" of text that is easy for a creator to read on camera without stuttering over hashtags or symbols.</p>

        <!-- Article 3 -->
        <article>
            <h2>3. Boosting Your Readability: From 'Complex' to 'Clear'</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Readability Score</strong> on CleanTextApp isn't just a number; it’s a tool for engagement. Academic or complex text (indicated by a red score) is often ignored on the web because it takes too much effort to process. For a blog post or school project, you want to aim for the "Simple" or "Average" green/orange tags.</p>
            <p>To improve a complex score, look for long, "run-on" sentences. Break one sentence of 40 words into two sentences of 20 words. CleanTextApp recalculates your score in real-time, allowing you to see exactly how your edits are making the text more accessible. Remember: the most brilliant ideas are the ones that are easiest to understand.</p>

        <!-- Article 4 -->
        <article>
            <h2>4. Cleaning AI-Generated Email Templates</h2>
            <p>Professional communication requires a personal touch. When you use AI to draft a business email, the output is often cluttered with bolded headers and list indicators like "1. Firstly..." or "- Bullet point."</p>
            <p>Before hitting send, paste your draft into CleanTextApp. Use the <strong>Purify</strong> button to change those messy dashes into clean, professional bullet points (•). If the AI generated the subject line in all caps or with weird symbols, use the <strong>lowercase</strong> converter and then capitalize the first letter for a hand-typed, professional look. This ensures your recipient focuses on your message, not the fact that a bot wrote it.</p>

        <!-- Article 5 -->
        <article>
            <h2>5. Creating a Clean Knowledge Base</h2>
            <p>For users who save AI research into apps like Notion, Obsidian, or Evernote, clean formatting is essential for future searchability. AI responses usually come with "chatter"—introductory phrases like "Certainly! Here is the information you requested" and concluding summaries.</p>
            <p>Use CleanTextApp to strip the "meat" of the information. Use <strong>Purify</strong> to remove the triple backticks used for code blocks or data tables, making them look native to your note-taking app. By removing the conversational fluff and keeping the structured data, your personal knowledge base remains professional, searchable, and easy to read months after you first saved the information.</p>
